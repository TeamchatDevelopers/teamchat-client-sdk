					<h4>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTENT</h4>
					<p>All materials displayed or performed on or accessible through the Site or Services (including, but not limited to text, graphics, articles, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video clips, application templates, applications also known as the  "Content") are protected by copyright. The term "Content" as used herein specifically includes any application or other content made available or submitted by any User. User shall abide by all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed in connection with the Services.</p>
					<p>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have access to your account).</p>

You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree that Webaroo shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of such User Content. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Webaroo Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.</p>
					<h4>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Usage</h4>
					<p><strong>General</strong><br/>
					This site may be used for messaging between users, either one-on-one or in small groups. Since messaging is a shared activity, content shared by users becomes co-owned by other users, subject to usage policies described here. Even when users leave the service, the content may continue to be co-owned by other users.</p>
					<p>Some areas of the Service may allow Users to post feedback, comments, questions, data, and other information ("User Content"). You are solely responsible for your User Content that you upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (hereinafter, "post") on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. Webaroo will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such User Content except as provided herein or in our Privacy Policy or as may be required by law. Absent a Network Administrator (as defined below), all such User Content is owned by the User who posted it to the Service, although each User acknowledges and consents that upon the introduction of a Network Administrator into that User's network, all related User Content will automatically become the property of the company to which the Network belongs without any notice to Users of that Network. If a Network has a Network Administrator, all such User Content is the property of the company to which the Network belongs (including all User Content posted to a specific Group or Groups within a Network and all User Content created prior to the existence of the Network Administrator). In either case, Webaroo does not have, nor does it claim, any ownership rights in any User Content. In addition, you should note that if you are no longer an eligible member of a network (e.g., you cease to be employed by the relevant company), your access to all User Content you uploaded may be terminated, regardless of whether the network has a Network Administrator. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company which administers that Network.</p>
					<p><strong>One-on-one messaging</strong><br/>
					Messages sent using one-on-one messaging shall remain confidential to the two users: the sender and the recipient. Webaroo does not view or share these messages with anyone else.</p>
					<p><strong>Groups</strong><br/>
					Individual Users may form a group to share messages more efficiently with each other. The creator of the group is designated as the Group Administrator ("Group Admin"). Each group shall have only one Group Admin, initially the creator. Users can join a group by invitation only, but can leave a group by themselves. A Group Administrator may&nbsp;add or remove Users to that particular Group. A group may also be converted to premium status ("Premium Group") to avail of additional features.</p>
					<p><strong>Organizations</strong><br/>
					This service includes an Administration Panel ("Admin Panel") that enables users to access certain advanced features. Using the Admin Panel, users can group themselves and other users into an Organization ("Org"). The creator of the Organization is the Organization Administrator ("Org Admin"). The Org Admin will have the ability to create premium groups or convert pre-existing groups to Premium Groups. Pre-existing groups will be converted to premium only with approval from the Group Admin. The Org Admin will have the ability to administer Premium Groups including, but not restricted to, adding / deleting its members, reading / writing and logging its messages etc. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company which administers that Network. The Group Admin shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their password and securing their account access.
					</p>
					<h4>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;License Grant</h4>
					<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, personal license to use the Service. Webaroo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Webaroo Content (as defined below). Unless Webaroo has agreed otherwise with respect to a Corporate Network, Webaroo may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
					<h4>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitation of Remedies and Damages</h4>
					<p>WEBAROO SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY (A) FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA OR, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUES AND LOSS OF PROFITS, OR (C) ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID WEBAROO IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, FIFTY DOLLARS ($50). WEBAROO SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL.</p>
					<h4>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Equitable Relief</h4>
					<p>You acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of Webaroo's Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of Your obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow You or third parties to unfairly compete with Webaroo resulting in irreparable harm to Webaroo, and therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, Webaroo shall be entitled to injunctions and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law.</p>
					<h4>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;SECURITY</h4>
					<p>As a condition to using Services, User may be required to enter his enterprise email address ("Teamchat User ID"). User shall provide Webaroo Inc. with accurate, complete, and updated information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of User's account. User may not (i) select or use as a Teamchat User ID an email id of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a Teamchat User ID an email id subject to any rights of a person other than User without appropriate authorization. Teamchat reserves the right to cancel a Teamchat User ID in its discretion. User shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of User's Teamchat account.</p>
					<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information and User Content from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information and User Content for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>
					<h4>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;INDEMNITY</h4>
					<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Webaroo and its subsidiaries, agents, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Service, including any data or work transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation, your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights or Intellectual Property Rights; (iv) your violation of any law, rule or regulation of the United States or any other country; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content or any that are submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party's access and use of the Service with your unique username or other appropriate security code.</p>
