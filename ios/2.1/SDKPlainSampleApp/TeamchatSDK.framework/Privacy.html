					<p>When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Webaroo to use your information in US and/or any other country where Webaroo operates.</p>
					<p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Webaroo Terms of Service. Your use of the Webaroo Application and Webaroo Services and any personal information you provide on the Webaroo Services or via Webaroo Application remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service.</p>
					<p>Webaroo is committed to protecting your privacy and to complying with applicable data protection and privacy laws. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we process personal data. Throughout this Policy the term "personal data" means information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (i.e. a natural person). "Webaroo" refers to Webaroo Corporation, including its affiliates (also referred to as "we", "us", or "our"). This Policy applies for processing of your personal data where Webaroo is the data controller or where we refer to the applicability of this Policy.</p>

					<p>In the activation process your personal identifiable information will be sent to Webaroo and we may associate this information with your active Webaroo Account/communities after securing permission. This combined information may be used to activate Webaroo App services and certain software licenses and to send you personalized messages, for example emails, and other messages. These messages may include information about Webaroo's products and services, such as tips and commercial offers. You may unsubscribe from these messages at any time for example by following the information in the message you receive after taking your device into use, instructions in the device or in the messages.
